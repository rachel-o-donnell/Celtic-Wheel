![This is an image](/assets/images/read-me-images/home-screen.png)

A multiple choice quiz for lovers of Greek mythology set in a sreen with a backdrop of one of the most famous paintings on this theme, Chamber of the Giants by Giulio Romano.

There is 3 difficulty levels to choose from easy, medium and hard so players of all levels are welcome!

---

## UX/UI:

**Target Audience:**

Lovers or enthusiasts of Greek mythology and fine art. A multiple choice method makes it more accessable to different knowledge levels as well as the choice to step up the challenge by choosing different difficulty levels. 

**Site Goals:** 

Users can easily navigate the game by use of of simple box displaying all interactive elements. Users can enter their initials coose a level of difficulty and begin the game. On the game screen the player can clearly see icons at the top of the screen with a clickable home button that bring them back to the home screen at any point in the game, a user icon displays their own initials that they entered, an icon of a tropy displays the score and a question icon shows the user what question they are on out of 8 . 

Each quesion is displayed with 4 options for answers, users can skip a question by pressing the next button, and control when they see the next question if they want to study the answer. After an answer is clicked a color change will occur -green for correct red for incorrect. When the player has answered 8 questions an end game screen will appear displaying a personalised message with the players name, score and level difficulty. A painting of a mythological significance will be displayed and the player has the option to play the game again, if they wish.

**User Stories:**

As a user I can enter my initials so I can personalise my experience.
As a user I can choose different difficulties so I can challenge myself further when I am ready.
As a user I can see my score go up and my answer button turn red or green so I can see if I have answered correctly.
As a user I can control when I see the next question so I can study the answer if I have answered incorrectly.
As a user I can press the next button so I skip a question if I dont want to guess.
As a user I can play again immediately so I can see if I can beat my last score.
As a user I can click the home button so I can exit to the home screen if I no longer want to play or want to change difficulty.

**Colour choice:**

I wanted a color scheme to feel classic, rich while remain somewhat neutral - they needed to feel like old colors of the time. I was very much inspired by the color choice of the below image for its calming, warm and complementary tones. 

![This is an image](/assets/images/read-me-images/color-inspo.png)

**Colours**
 Based on this I started pulling out some tones and ended up with the below palette.

 #e3a857 - ochre
 #6E6259 - slate gray
 #FAFAD2 - pale yellow
 #380456 - dark purple 
 #301934 - darker purple: I addded the darker purple font for more acceability while being a complimentary color to the mustard.
 #8B0000 - red : I opted for richer palette for the red and green that would appear older and sit within the mustard and not appear garish.
#004600 - green

## HERO IMAGE

![This is an image](/assets/images/chamber.png)

Hero image:
Chamber of the Giants by Giulio Romano taken from
https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chamber-of-the-giants

This rich painting provides a great backdrop as it features so many mythical characters, spiraling around the game screen.

"It tells the story of the fall of the giants, as described by the Latin poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses. The god Jupiter is pictured on the ceiling, surrounded by the entire Roman cosmogony. The painting shows the moment he threw his lighting to destroy the giants. On the surrounding walls, there are images of crumbling buildings and desperate giants trying to escape." 
quote taken directly from https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chamber-of-the-giants

End of game : 

I wanted to show a different painting going from most easily recocniseable to more obscure as you go along to represent the categories themselves. 
This research solidified my choice of color scheme as all images look at home within the game screen and create a beautifully indulgent pattern contrast when layered

## Wireframes:

Wireframes were made with Balsamiq and can be found ![here](/assets/wireframes-new/home.png

Originally I wanted to have the game based on the Celtic wheel of the year but chose to change that on discovery of API. My origianl wireframes were very different as they were to have 8 images in a circle.

## FEATURES:

**Background image:** 

Once I found the background image I knew is would work perfectly to act as a background that would draw the players attention to the centre of the screen with its circular layout while still being an incredible texture compliment to the flat ochre screen.

**Game Panel:** 
![This is an image](/assets/images/read-me-images/game-panel.png)

https://miker94.github.io/CI-Project-Portfolio-2/ I absolutely loved the style and design of this quiz so Ive been looking a lot at Mike's code to see how he created it but changing as much as possible to suit my needs and simplify it. Mostly I am using the idea of the game screen with all the info centered. Initially I wanted my quiz to be about the Celtic Calendar but after learning about API I needed to change my subject and design. I chose to use an API rather than write all my questions - really just so I could practice on how to use API. 

Used how to add background image directly- I couldnt find a way to add and style differently that would work. I changed mine only by adding it to the body element and not the html ????? DID I CHANGE THIS BACK ????.

 Otiginally I had a grey background but I had tyed with the idea of adding images. When I changed my idea to a mythology I immediatly knew I would want to add some rich, classical imagaery. 
 Background image taken from google search on mythological fine art paintings. This was perfect as has many mythological characters and as its painted on a ceiling I feel you can get the feeling of looking up into the sky as you anser your questions- spiraling into a void/ its spiral deign hold the game centre nicely no matter what the screen size.

## BUGS FIXED:

.dropdown background color changed when I added a margin bottom to the button element. Added new background color.
Only had a  margin left 15px to h2 so it stuck too far to the right when on a smaller screen (320px) changed to margin 0 10px to be more balanced. 

game panel was pushed down so there was a space on top no matter how many hides I addded.
Removed justify-content on name-area (need to add listener) then styled.s

Font awesome icon missing when You input username - Had to take it out of the text area

redesign username to initials instead as a name pushed the game panel to be too crowded on a mobile device. 

surrounded icon and li partners in game panel with containers to style side by side but still separated out n the screen. 

Could not make home ontaner disappear by adding any of the hide classes I had previously made. From playing in dev tools I knew adding display:none worked so I found the correct syntax at https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/add-styles-to-an-element/ (homeContainer.style.display = 'none')

game kept getting reset to home when answer button was pressed - Changed form to section and that fixed the problem thanks to Sean Young's help on Slack!

game screens not displaying because they had been set to flex i style.css so I made JS add display style to only brin up the containers with display flex when they were called by a function like- begin and endgame. 

Fix bug of not displaying the next question"
needed to inscrease currentquestion index in next button call and declare the variable outside of the choose next question function

fa-solid was at 0 5px 10px so would not manipulate with margin- right (I renamed them panel-elements)

major overhaul of html structure - trying to get panel to separate and run on the same line but after fixing home by adding the display flex the user icon still runs lower than the others . Tried flex end but that doesnt move it and when I apply that to the others they move way too low.
--- !!!!!!!!cone back to this I think

Fix bug of other category image showing up on 2nd round - needed to add hides 

on 2nd game it would stop working when the questions ran out so I needed to hook up a new function of reloading the game to its original state to clear the questions. default was selected in dropdown so people can change category. used w3 schools to default selected and get reload code.

Required elements on home screen - initials input and dropdown rewuired was not being recognised because I had event listeners attached in js. So had to access this feature through JS. Had to change the event listener to run the game only when the name and select areas were filled.
