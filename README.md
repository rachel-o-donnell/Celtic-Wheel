## CREDITS:

**Code:**
Using Love Running and my last project ******INSERT LINK****  as guidlines to rememeber Html and CSS,Love Maths as a guide for JS and adapting all to my needs and design for this project. 
Heavily relying on Dev Tooos to play around and find the right fit.

LOVE MATHS - code for increasing score and questioncount.

https://miker94.github.io/CI-Project-Portfolio-2/ I absolutely loved the style and design of this quiz so Ive been looking a lot at Mike's code to see how he created it but changing as much as possible to suit my needs and simplify it. Mostly I am using the idea of the game screen with all the info centered. Initially I wanted my quiz to be about the Celtic Calendar but after learning about API I needed to change my subject and design. I chose to use an API rather than write all my questions - really just so I could practice on how to use API. 

Used how to add background image directly- I couldnt find a way to add and style differently that would work. I changed mine only by adding it to the body element and not the html ????? DID I CHANGE THIS BACK ????. 
 
 Dropdown code: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp

 Image:
 Otiginally I had a grey background but I had tyed with the idea of adding images. When I changed my idea to a mythology I immediatly knew I would want to add some rich, classical imagaery. 
 Background image taken from google search on mythological fine art paintings. This was perfect as has many mythological characters and as its painted on a ceiling I feel you can get the feeling of looking up into the sky as you anser your questions- spiraling into a void/ its spiral deign hold the game centre nicely no matter what the screen size. I changed my styling to suit the image .  https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/chamber-of-the-giants-giulio-romano/kwH6-YlTRSD9fA?ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.5%2C%22y%22%3A0.5%2C%22z%22%3A9.70138

## BUGS FIXED:

.dropdown background color changed when I added a margin bottom to the button element. Added new background color.
Only had a  margin left 15px to h2 so it stuck too far to the right when on a smaller screen (320px) changed to margin 0 10px to be more balanced. 

game panel was pushed down so there was a space on top no matter how many hides I addded.
Removed justify-content on name-area (need to add listener) then styled.s

Font awesome icon missing when You input username - Had to take it out of the text area

redesign username to initials instead as a name pushed the game panel to be too crowded on a mobile device. 

surrounded icon and li partners in game panel with containers to style side by side but still separated out n the screen. 

Could not make home ontaner disappear by adding any of the hide classes I had previously made. From playing in dev tools I knew adding display:none worked so I found the correct syntax at https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/add-styles-to-an-element/ (homeContainer.style.display = 'none')

game kept getting reset to home when answer button was pressed - Changed form to section and that fixed the problem thanks to Sean Young's help on Slack!

game screens not displaying because they had been set to flex i style.css so I made JS add display style to only brin up the containers with display flex when they were called by a function like- begin and endgame. 

Fix bug of not displaying the next question"
needed to inscrease currentquestion index in next button call and declare the variable outside of the choose next question function

fa-solid was at 0 5px 10px so would not manipulate with margin- right (I renamed them panel-elements)

major overhaul of html structure - trying to get panel to separate and run on the same line but after fixing home by adding the display flex the user icon still runs lower than the others . Tried flex end but that doesnt move it and when I apply that to the others they move way too low.
--- !!!!!!!!cone back to this I think

TO BE FIXED: 
html dropdown styling does not work.  IS IT BECAUSE I CHANGED TO FORM???
