## CREDITS:

**Code:**
Using Love Running and my last project ******INSERT LINK****  as guidlines to rememeber Html and CSS,Love Maths as a guide for JS and adapting all to my needs and design for this project. 
Heavily relying on Dev Tooos to play around and find the right fit.

https://miker94.github.io/CI-Project-Portfolio-2/ I absolutely loved the style and design of this quiz so Ive been looking a lot at Mike's code to see how he created it but changing as much as possible to suit my needs and simplify it. Mostly I am using the idea of the game screen with all the info centered. Initially I wanted my quiz to be about the Celtic Calendar but after learning about API I needed to change my subject and design. I chose to use an API rather than write all my questions - really just so I could practice on how to use API.

## BUGS FIXED:

.dropdown background color changed when I added a margin bottom to the button element. Added new backgrounf color.
Only had a  margin left 15px to h2 so it stuck too far to the right when on a smaller screen (320px) changed to margin 0 10px to be more balanced.
