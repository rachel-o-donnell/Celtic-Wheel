## CREDITS:

**Code:**
Using Love Running and my last project ******INSERT LINK****  as guidlines to rememeber Html and CSS,Love Maths as a guide for JS and adapting all to my needs and design for this project. 
Heavily relying on Dev Tooos to play around and find the right fit.

https://miker94.github.io/CI-Project-Portfolio-2/ I absolutely loved the style and design of this quiz so Ive been looking a lot at Mike's code to see how he created it but changing as much as possible to suit my needs and simplify it. Mostly I am using the idea of the game screen with all the info centered. Initially I wanted my quiz to be about the Celtic Calendar but after learning about API I needed to change my subject and design. I chose to use an API rather than write all my questions - really just so I could practice on how to use API. 

Used how to add background image directly- I couldnt find a way to add and style differently that would work. I changed mine only by adding it to the body element and not the html ????? DID I CHANGE THIS BACK ????.

 Otiginally I had a grey background but I had tyed with the idea of adding images. When I changed my idea to a mythology I immediatly knew I would want to add some rich, classical imagaery. 
 Background image taken from google search on mythological fine art paintings. This was perfect as has many mythological characters and as its painted on a ceiling I feel you can get the feeling of looking up into the sky as you anser your questions- spiraling into a void/ its spiral deign hold the game centre nicely no matter what the screen size. I changed my styling to suit the image .  https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/chamber-of-the-giants-giulio-romano/kwH6-YlTRSD9fA?ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.5%2C%22y%22%3A0.5%2C%22z%22%3A9.70138

## BUGS FIXED:

.dropdown background color changed when I added a margin bottom to the button element. Added new backgrounf color.
Only had a  margin left 15px to h2 so it stuck too far to the right when on a smaller screen (320px) changed to margin 0 10px to be more balanced. 

game panel was pushed down so there was a space on top no matter how many hides I addded.
Removed justify-content on name-area (need to add listener) then styled.s
